# Introduction to R & Rstudio (Using R, using RStudio, simple math, assignment of variables)

## Overview
Howdy y'all! This GitHub repository is for participants of [Texas A&M's Open Source for Open Science workshop](https://eeb.tamu.edu/open-source-open-science/open-source-for-open-science-workshop-2025/#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20Ecology%20%26%20Evolutionary%20Biology's,the%20Texas%20A%26M%20University%20campus).

This module will be covering the basics of R and Rstudio.

R is a programming language that is specialized for working with data and generating graphics. One of its greatest strengths is its use of open-source libraries called packages, which allow users to improve the functionality and features of R. An example of an R package is "dplyr", which is commonly used for data manipulation and makes data handling & cleaning a breeze. 

For this module, I have adapted many of the resources available for the R & Rstudio module published by [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro.html).

## Objectives
1. Understand the necessity for, and use of, R
2. Learn how to navigate RStudio
3. Know how to assign variables / objects
4. Be able to identify the 5 main data types of R

## Getting Started
