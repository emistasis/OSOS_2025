# What is the shell?

## Background
Typically, when we use a computer, we provide the computer with some instruction and tell it to perform a task. For example, if I am interested in opening up Google Chrome, I click on the Google Chrome icon, signaling to my computer that I want the application to open.

Icons, buttons, and menus are part of what we refer to as a **graphical user interface (GUI)**. A GUI use visual elements to provide users with an interactive, intuitive way of engaging with the computer. Although GUIs are more user-friendly, your ability to interact with your computer to perform specific tasks is limited.

Imagine the following scenario: your collaborator has just emailed you thousands of messy raw data files. In order for these files to be used, you need to clean and reformat them. Are you going to individual go through each file to do this? What a nightmare... Instead, maybe you can write a Bash script to automate this.

## The Shell
The shell is a program where users can provide commands. The shell can be used to provoke programs, such as a genome assembler, or simple commands.
