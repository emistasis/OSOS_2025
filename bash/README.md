# Introduction to Bash & the Command Line

## Overview

Howdy y'all! This GitHub repository is for participants of [Texas A&M's Open Source for Open Science workshop](https://eeb.tamu.edu/open-source-open-science/open-source-for-open-science-workshop-2025/#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20Ecology%20%26%20Evolutionary%20Biology's,the%20Texas%20A%26M%20University%20campus).

This module will be covering the basics of Bash and command-line.

Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a Unix shell and command language. Bash allows us to control our operating system and perform tasks, often with just a couple commands or lines of codes. Bash is especially useful when users are interested in automating repetitive tasks.

For this module, I have adapted many of the resources available for the Unix Shell module published by [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html).

## Objectives

1.  Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line
2.  Learn how to navigate file systems and explore file contents
3.  Utilize basic operations (e.g., move, create, copy, and rename)

## Getting Started

Because each person will be using a different operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux), we need to standardize our "environment."

### Windows Users

Computers with a Windows operating systems do not come with a Unix shell installed. Therefore, you will need to install a Unix shell onto your computer, for which you have a few options:

-   Option 1 (recommended): You can install [Git for Windows](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell). Git for Windows gives you access to both Bash and [Git](https://clevercoderjoy.hashnode.dev/eli5-git-the-version-control-systemvcs). Git, at its core, is simply a software that can track different versions of files created by multiple users. It is often used by programmers who are developing software collaboratively.

-   Option 2: You can install [Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (“WSL 2”)](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell).

### MacOS Users

Congrats! Older Mac computers (Mojave and earlier releases) use Bash, and newer computers (Catalina and later releases) use Zsh. Bash and Zsh are very similar in their functionality, so you should be *good to go*. To access the shell, you need to open the Terminal program.

### Linux Users

Congrats! The default Unix shell is almost always Bash for Linux operating systems. Therefore, you should not need to install anything.
