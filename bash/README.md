# Introduction to Bash & the Command Line

## Description
Howdy y'all! This GitHub repository is for participants of [Texas A&M's Open Source for Open Science workshop](https://eeb.tamu.edu/open-source-open-science/open-source-for-open-science-workshop-2025/#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20Ecology%20%26%20Evolutionary%20Biology's,the%20Texas%20A%26M%20University%20campus). This module will be reviewing the basics of Bash and the command-line.

Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) is a Unix shell and command language. Bash allows us to control our operating system through the command-line. This module will likely be most relevant to users who need to run software on their personal computers that require using the command-line or users of the supercomputer.

Before we begin, let's quickly go over some definitions:

**Shell** - a program that processes that commands that you provide and outputs the results (such as Bash!)

**Command line** - an interface that accepts commands.

**Terminal** - a program that runs the shell and allows us to enter commands.

**Console** - a type of terminal, in which your programs are active (think Xbox!)

## Objectives
1. Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line
2. Learn how to navigate file systems and explore file contents
3. Utilize basic operations (e.g., move, create, copy, and rename)

## Before the module
Because each person will be using a different operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux), we need to standardize our "environment." In order to do so, we will be utilizing [Google's Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/?show=ide%2Cterminal). Google Cloud Shell should be accessible using your TAMU affilitated email.

For those of you who plan to utilize bash much more frequently, I encourage you to download a UNIX terminal (if you are using a Mac or Linux, it is automatically available) and a text editor.

If you have any questions or concerns prior to the module, please contact me.
